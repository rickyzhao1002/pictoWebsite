<h2>Proprietary Rights in Content on Pictolike</h2>
1. Pictolike does NOT claim ANY ownership rights in the text, files, images, photos, video, 
sounds, musical works, works of authorship, applications, or any other materials 
(collectively, "Content") that you post on or through the Pictolike Services. By displaying 
or publishing ("posting") any Content on or through the Pictolike Services, you hereby 
grant to Pictolike a non-exclusive, fully paid and royalty-free, worldwide, limited license 
to use, modify, delete from, add to, publicly perform, publicly display, reproduce and 
translate such Content, including without limitation distributing part or all of the Site in 
any media formats through any media channels, except Content not shared publicly 
("private") will not be distributed outside the Pictolike Services. <br>
2. Some of the Pictolike Services are supported by advertising revenue and may display 
advertisements and promotions, and you hereby agree that Pictolike may place such 
advertising and promotions on the Pictolike Services or on, about, or in conjunction with 
your Content. The manner, mode and extent of such advertising and promotions are 
subject to change without specific notice to you. <br>
3. You represent and warrant that: (i) you own the Content posted by you on or through the 
Pictolike Services or otherwise have the right to grant the license set forth in this section, 
(ii) the posting and use of your Content on or through the Pictolike Services does not 
violate the privacy rights, publicity rights, copyrights, contract rights, intellectual property 
rights or any other rights of any person, and (iii) the posting of your Content on the Site 
does not result in a breach of contract between you and a third party. You agree to pay 
for all royalties, fees, and any other monies owing any person by reason of Content you 
post on or through the Pictolike Services. <br>
4. The Pictolike Services contain Content of Pictolike ("Pictolike Content"). Pictolike 
Content is protected by copyright, trademark, patent, trade secret and other laws, and 
Pictolike owns and retains all rights in the Pictolike Content and the Pictolike Services. 
Pictolike hereby grants you a limited, revocable, nonsublicensable license to reproduce and display the Pictolike Content (excluding any software code) solely for your personal 
use in connection with viewing the Site and using the Pictolike Services. <br>
5. The Pictolike Services contain Content of Users and other Pictolike licensors. Except as 
provided within this Agreement, you may not copy, modify, translate, publish, broadcast, 
transmit, distribute, perform, display, or sell any Content appearing on or through the 
Pictolike Services. <br>
6. Pictolike performs technical functions necessary to offer the Pictolike Services, including 
but not limited to transcoding and/or reformatting Content to allow its use throughout the 
Pictolike Services. <br>
7. Although the Site and other Pictolike Services are normally available, there will be 
occasions when the Site or other Pictolike Services will be interrupted for scheduled 
maintenance or upgrades, for emergency repairs, or due to failure of 
telecommunications links and equipment that are beyond the control of Pictolike. Also, 
although Pictolike will normally only delete Content that violates this Agreement, 
Pictolike reserves the right to delete any Content for any reason, without prior notice. 
Deleted content may be stored by Pictolike in order to comply with certain legal

suspension, or discontinuation of the Pictolike Services, or the loss of any Content. </p>
